A RDFa breadcrumbs generator, specifically made for SEO purposes, that works in every scenario and displays the correct rich snippets in Google.

== Description ==

**DP RDFa Breacrumb Generator is the ultimate breadcrumb plugin**. It is made by an SEO for other SEO's, who was frustrated by the fact that there weren't any valid alternatives.

Key features of this plugin: 

* Is 100% based on Google's suggestions ([click here for more details](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/185417?hl=en))

* Works in every possible scenario: pages and sub-pages, categories and sub-categories, tags, posts (in this case, it can even handle posts with multiple categories, showing different breadcrumbs with the v:child markup, as Google suggests)

* Google's Structured Data Testing Tool always says that everything is perfect (take a look at the results of one of my italian posts [here](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.danilopetrozzi.it%2Fone-time-pad-messaggi-criptati-inattaccabili-a-prova-di-nsa&hl=en))

* The RDFa markup is well handled by Google: in just a few days/weeks, every page will have it's own breadcrumb rich snippets in search results pages. (see screenshots)

* A rich options page allows you to set where the breadcrumbs will show and "how" 

* Visually customizable thanks to specific CSS classes added to every single element

* If you need a breadcrumb plugin for SEO purposes, that's what you were looking for :)

== Installation ==

1. Upload `/dp-rdfa-breadcrumb-generator/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place this PHP code wherever you want:
`<?php if(function_exists('dp_breadcrumb')){echo dp_breadcrumb();} ?>` 
or use the shortcode:
`[dp_breadcrumb_generator]`

== Screenshots ==

1. Screenshot of the settings page
2. Screenshot of Google's Structured Data Testing Tool analysis. As you can see, even with multiple breacdrumbs everything is perfect thanks to the correct use of RDFa's v:child syntax.
